# Nabu

An application designed to create and encourage healthy habit building.

---

## Introduction

A simple, and easy-to-use Android application which tracks your habits for the days of the week, reminds & encourages you for those habits, and lets you interact with friends to see what they're doing.

## Project Structure

The Android Studio project can be opened from the `/src` directory.

UML documentation and group information can be found in the `/doc` directory.

Mockup and Storyboard design files can be found in the `/design` directory.

### Running Model Tests

Model tests run on-device, and thus require an Android Emulator. In addition, the following steps should be taken:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 10.13.0 or later).
2. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) with `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
3. Login with the account `CMPUT301F21T22@gmail.com`/`V-@*stJZ.3C` in order to access the expected Firebase project.
4. Ensure the working directory is the Android Studio project directory with `cd <PATH_TO_PROJECT>/Nabu/src`.
5. Start the emulators with `firebase emulators:start`.
